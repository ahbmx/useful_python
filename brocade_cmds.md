For Brocade X7-8 Directors (running FOS ‚Äì Fabric OS), especially in environments using **Virtual Fabrics**, you can use the following CLI commands to check **capacity**, **health**, **connectivity between fabrics and ISLs**, and **port errors**.

Make sure you‚Äôre logged into the correct logical switch if you're using Virtual Fabrics.

---

### üß© **1. Switch Capacity (Ports, Blades, Usage)**

**General port status:**

```bash
switchshow
```

**Show slot and port usage:**

```bash
slotshow
```

**Port licensing (to see licensed capacity):**

```bash
licenseportshow
```

**Show hardware blade information:**

```bash
bladeshow
```

**Check the number of ports used/free:**

```bash
portshow | grep "state"
```

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **2. Switch Health**

**Basic health summary:**

```bash
switchstatusshow
```

**Power supplies, fans, temperature:**

```bash
fanshow
tempshow
psshow
```

**General diagnostics:**

```bash
diagshow
```

**Check for any issues (like errors, CRCs, or marginal ports):**

```bash
errdump
errshow
```

**RASlog (for deeper hardware/software events):**

```bash
raslog
```

---

### üîó **3. ISL Connectivity & Inter-Fabric Links (IFLs)**

**Display ISLs:**

```bash
islshow
```

**Check E-Ports (ISLs):**

```bash
portshow <port_number>
```

Look for:

* Port type: `E-Port`
* Link status: `Up`
* Distance/Buffer credits

**Show routing information between virtual fabrics:**

```bash
fabricshow
```

**Display all logical switches in VF-enabled system:**

```bash
lscfg --show
```

**Check inter-switch connectivity in VF environments:**

```bash
lsdbshow
```

---

### ‚ùó **4. Port Errors and Health**

**Per-port detailed stats:**

```bash
porterrshow
```

**Clears port error counters (good before/after comparison):**

```bash
statsclear
```

**Monitor live port performance:**

```bash
portperfshow
```

**Persistent port health history:**

```bash
porthealthshow
```

**Track error counts per physical port (good for ISLs, targets, HBAs):**

```bash
portstatsshow <port_number>
```

---

### üì¶ **Bonus - Logical Switch Commands (Virtual Fabrics)**

**Check all logical switches:**

```bash
lscfg --show
```

**Switch context to another logical switch:**

```bash
setcontext <LS_ID>
```

**Check which logical switch you're in:**

```bash
fabricshow
```

**Show which ports are assigned to which logical switch:**

```bash
portcfgshow
```
