To build a spreadsheet using `pandas` and `XlsxWriter` that represents a **Brocade X7-8 Director**, you'll want to structure the data to show:

* **Slots** (1 through 8 typically for an X7-8)
* **Ports** per slot (up to 64 ports per blade depending on the blade model)
* **WWNs** per port (if known)
* **Connected Hosts** (if any)

Hereâ€™s a sample Python script to generate this spreadsheet:

---

### âœ… Requirements:

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas xlsxwriter
```

---

### ðŸ“„ Script Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data: for real-world use, pull this from your SAN switch using Brocade CLI/REST API
slots = range(1, 9)  # 8 slots for X7-8
ports_per_slot = 32  # assume 32 ports per blade for simplicity

# Create dummy data
data = []
for slot in slots:
    for port in range(ports_per_slot):
        port_id = f"{slot}/{port}"
        wwn = f"10:00:00:00:{slot:02x}:{port:02x}:00:01"
        host = f"Host_{slot}_{port}" if port % 4 == 0 else ""  # pretend every 4th port has a host
        data.append({
            "Slot": slot,
            "Port": port,
            "Port ID": port_id,
            "WWN": wwn,
            "Connected Host": host
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create Excel writer
writer = pd.ExcelWriter("brocade_x7_8_director.xlsx", engine='xlsxwriter')
df.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name="Director Map")

# Format for Excel sheet
workbook  = writer.book
worksheet = writer.sheets["Director Map"]

# Set column widths for readability
worksheet.set_column("A:A", 6)
worksheet.set_column("B:B", 6)
worksheet.set_column("C:C", 10)
worksheet.set_column("D:D", 24)
worksheet.set_column("E:E", 20)

# Optional: Add header format
header_format = workbook.add_format({
    'bold': True,
    'bg_color': '#D7E4BC',
    'border': 1
})
for col_num, value in enumerate(df.columns.values):
    worksheet.write(0, col_num, value, header_format)

writer.close()
print("Spreadsheet 'brocade_x7_8_director.xlsx' created.")
```

---

### ðŸ§¾ Output Columns:

* **Slot** â€“ Slot number (1-8)
* **Port** â€“ Port number (0-31)
* **Port ID** â€“ Slot/Port (e.g., 1/0)
* **WWN** â€“ Fabric-assigned WWN (dummy values)
* **Connected Host** â€“ Host connected to the port (optional/mock data)

---

Would you like the WWN/Host data to be pulled from a live SAN switch or merged from another dataset (like a CMDB or zoning database)?




To build a **PowerMax-to-Hosts connectivity map** in Excel using `pandas` and `XlsxWriter`, youâ€™ll want to reflect the SAN-like structure of a **Dell EMC PowerMax array**, showing:

* **Directors** (e.g., FA ports like 1E:0, 1E:1, etc.)
* **Ports on each director**
* **WWNs of the ports**
* **Connected hosts** and their WWNs

---

### âœ… What We'll Include:

* PowerMax **Front-End Directors (FEDs)**
* Ports on those directors
* **WWNs** for each port (simulated)
* **Connected hosts** with WWNs (simulated)

---

### ðŸ“„ Python Script (Simulated Example):

```python
import pandas as pd

# Simulated configuration
directors = ["1E", "2E"]  # Front-end directors
ports_per_director = 4    # Assume 4 ports per director for simplicity

# Simulated host connections
connected_hosts = [
    {"director": "1E", "port": 0, "host": "host01", "host_wwn": "10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:01"},
    {"director": "1E", "port": 1, "host": "host02", "host_wwn": "10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:02"},
    {"director": "2E", "port": 0, "host": "host03", "host_wwn": "10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:03"},
    {"director": "2E", "port": 2, "host": "host04", "host_wwn": "10:00:00:00:c9:12:34:04"},
]

# Build the data table
data = []
for director in directors:
    for port in range(ports_per_director):
        port_id = f"{director}:{port}"
        port_wwn = f"50:00:d3:10:{ord(director[0]):02x}:{port:02x}:00:01"  # Simulated WWN
        connected_host = next((h for h in connected_hosts if h["director"] == director and h["port"] == port), None)
        host_name = connected_host["host"] if connected_host else ""
        host_wwn = connected_host["host_wwn"] if connected_host else ""
        data.append({
            "Director": director,
            "Port": port,
            "Port ID": port_id,
            "Port WWN": port_wwn,
            "Connected Host": host_name,
            "Host WWN": host_wwn
        })

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Write to Excel
writer = pd.ExcelWriter("powermax_connectivity.xlsx", engine='xlsxwriter')
df.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name="PowerMax Connectivity")

# Format Excel sheet
workbook  = writer.book
worksheet = writer.sheets["PowerMax Connectivity"]

# Set column widths for readability
worksheet.set_column("A:A", 10)
worksheet.set_column("B:B", 6)
worksheet.set_column("C:C", 12)
worksheet.set_column("D:D", 24)
worksheet.set_column("E:E", 15)
worksheet.set_column("F:F", 24)

# Add header style
header_format = workbook.add_format({
    'bold': True,
    'bg_color': '#DCE6F1',
    'border': 1
})
for col_num, value in enumerate(df.columns.values):
    worksheet.write(0, col_num, value, header_format)

writer.close()
print("Spreadsheet 'powermax_connectivity.xlsx' created.")
```

### ðŸ§¾ Spreadsheet Columns:

* **Director** â€“ PowerMax front-end director ID (e.g., 1E, 2E)
* **Port** â€“ Port number on the director
* **Port ID** â€“ Concatenation (e.g., `1E:0`)
* **Port WWN** â€“ Simulated WWN of the port
* **Connected Host** â€“ Host name connected to that port
* **Host WWN** â€“ WWN of the connected host

---

### ðŸ”„ Want Live Data?

You can pull real data via:

* `symcfg list -connections` (from Unisphere CLI)
* `syminq`, `symaccess`, or `symcfg` outputs
* REST API from Unisphere for PowerMax

I can help parse those outputs into this format too. Would you like to import from a real `symaccess` or `symcfg` output next?
